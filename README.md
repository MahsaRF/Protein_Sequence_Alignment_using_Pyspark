Protein_Sequence_Alignment_using_Pyspark


implement a Pyspark version of the code which is able to do the sequence alignment of the 
input protein sequence and all its variants with every single sequences of the database and 
then sort the matching candidates according to their similarity score and report the top 10 
best matches of the input protein with the database proteins.

This project was submitted as part of a Big Data Analytics course taught by Professor Edgar Gabriel at the University of Houston Fall 2021
